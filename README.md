### What is Weapon Randomizer

Weapon Randomizer is a script that creates a mod randomizing weapons. It can randomize standalone, enemy and chest weapons (you can choose whicih type in `config.json`). You can also choose whether or not the mod should autoinstall with BCML with the `autoinstall` option. Before attempting to launch the script, make sure all of its packages are installed (`pip install package` with `package` being bcml, oead, botw_flag_util, shutil). Then, you can launch `weapon_randomizer.py` and wait until it finishes. If you didn't use autoinstall, a mod will be created in the root of this folder. You will be able to install it with BCML. DO NOT USE IT AS A SIMPLE GRAPHIC PACKS WITHOUT USING BCML ! The RSTB isn't generated automatically for this mod by this script.
